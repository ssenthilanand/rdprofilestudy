        <h2><em>The Computational Model and the Tool</em></h2>
    </header>


    <article style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>Here we  outline of the computational model developed by us to compute the R&D strength of  the university in a 
            given area, as well as the R&D strength of a given faculty member in all his/her areas of specialisation.</p>

        <p>There are two major parts to this exercise:</p>

        <h4><em>1.	Identifying which are the areas of specialisation that must be considered in a given university.</em></h4>

        <p>Typically a large university will have many hundreds of faculty members divided into scores of departments, divisions, 
            centres etc, carrying out a variety of activities that go into making its  R&D strength, as listed in the previous section, 
            such as publications, theses, patents, funded R&D  etc. What should a university take to be its areas of specialisation 
            for the purpose of estimating its the R&D strength is a matter of considerable complexity, and this may not be the same across all the universities. </p>

        <p>To illustrate, in an engineering university, it wouldn't be enough to consider Civil, Electrical, Mechanical etc to be 
            the areas of specialised R&D as they are too broad and coarse in granularity, each breaking down into many more specialised 
            areas and sub areas. At another extreme, there may be just one or two faculty members working on a very narrow and highly 
            specialised problem, and at the university level , these may not qualify to be listed as research areas of the university as 
            they are too fine grained. What would be needed is an optimum level of granularity where the choice of areas of 
            specialisation is not too coarse to loose meaning or not too fine to loose usefulness.</p>

        <p>Experts in the university have to deliberate and decide on this aspect based on the breadth and depth of R&D being 
            carried out there. It is evident that certain areas that exist in one university may not exist in another, etc.</p>

        <p>Later in this report we explain how this problem is being addressed in this study for the present.</p>

        <h4><em>2.  Deciding how the R&D strength of a faculty member or an area of specialisation is to be computed.</em></h4>

        <p>R&D strength in an area would have to take into account the different types of R&D outputs generated in that area, 
            such as publications, theses, patents, etc, as listed in the previous section. Evidently, these can not be just a 
            numerical addition of all such items, as they all have different units and dimensions, as well as different levels 
            of importance in contributing to the final calculated R&D strength.  To illustrate, it has to be decided how much 
            importance publications should be given in the calculation of R&D strength, as compared to say R&D grants brought in, 
            patents taken, etc. That is,  there has to a “weight” assigned to each type of contributions that go into the 
            calculation of the R&D strength, and this would reflect what the university considers to be the relative importance 
            of different types of contributions – some may consider publications to be more importance than R&D grants, 
            where as some others may do the opposite, etc.</p>

        <p>Even when the weights for different types of contributions have been agreed up on, how the contributions have to 
            be quantified and calculated for a given type is another issue to be decided. Taking the example of publications 
            again, the value of contribution assigned to this type can not just be the total number of publications; 
            the 'quality' of the journals or conferences where they were published (say the h-index of the journal) 
            will also be very important in deciding the value of this contribution.</p>

        <p>Similar considerations apply to deciding the relative importance of all other types of R&D contributions that 
            go into deciding the relative R&D strength of an area of specialisation in the university, or of 
            a faculty member of the university in an area.</p>
        
        <p>We have built the model for computing the R&D strength in a university through defining a factor s(i,j) as 
            being the R&D strength of the faculty member i in the area of specialisation j. Contributions of various 
            types mentioned earlier by the faculty member i in the area j are summed together with appropriate ways 
            of quantification and weights. Details of this would be described elsewhere.</p>

        <p>The final R&D strength of the university in the area of specialisation j, S(j) is obtained by summing s(i,j) 
            over all the faculty members i in the university, and similarly, the final R&D strength of the faculty i 
            in all the areas of his/her specialisation, S(i) is got by summing s(i,j) over all the areas j.</p>
