        <h2><em>III. Obtaining the R&D Profile of a university using the IRINS database</em></h2>
    </header>


    <article style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>Most universities do not have a centralised on line database of its faculty members and their profiles made
            available over the web.
            Faculty members however do maintain their personal webpages as a part of their Department/Centre websites,
            and anyone wanting
            to analyse the R&D profiles of the faculty members of the university has to go to these Department/Centre
            websites and pull out
            the required information from the individual faculty web pages available there. This is a very tedious
            process, and
            often the individual pages of many faculty members are also incomplete in many regards for our purposes.</p>

        <h4><em>The IRINS Database:</em></h4>

        <p>
            IRINS <a href="https://irins.org/irins/">(https://irins.org/irins/)</a> is a web-based Research Information
            Management (RIM)
            service developed recently by the Information and Library Network(INFLIBNET) Centre Delhi in collaboration
            with the Central
            University of Punjab. Anna University has populated the template supplied by IRINS with data of
            about 500 of its regular faculty, and is available at <a
                hre="https://annauniv.irins.org/">https://annauniv.irins.org/</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Nearly 250 universities and institutes in India (Central government, State government as well as Private)
            have
            created their own versions of IRINS data bases, and this to our knowledge represents only one such
            instance that is available for public viewing and access at present.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though there is provision to add more fields as desired by the individual faculty members,
            most of the IRINS websites of universities have chosen to have only a few fields populated;
            in case of Anna University, only the following fields have been filled up by most of the 500 faculty
            members:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Information</li>
            <li>Expertise</li>
            <li>Experience</li>
            <li>Educational Qualifications</li>
            <li>Publications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            List of Publications however looks quite incomplete as well as defective in many cases and may not be much
            usable as it is. More importantly, the following information is not available in most cases, which are
            essential for our purpose of computing R&D strength as discussed earlier:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Externally funded activities taken up such as Sponsored R&D, Consultancy, Training etc.</li>
            <li>Titles of Ph. D. Theses supervised</li>
            <li>Technologies/ IP s/ Patents produced</li>
            <li>Conferences Organised</li>
            <li>Networking & Collaborations</li>
            <li>Specialised Courses taught</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Thus, the IRINS database in the form as presently available in many cases such as Anna University is still
            quite removed from the comprehensive ones needed as mentioned earlier, though it is a good beginning
            and could be improved up on by interested institutions.</p>

        <p>
            For our purpose of computing the R&D strengths, the “Areas of Expertise” field filled up by the faculty
            members in IRINS is quite useful and usable directly. This is where the faculty members enter their
            broad areas of activity (“Aerospace”) as well as specialised R&D areas (“Propulsion”), and as mentioned
            in <a href="part2.html#II.1">(II)(1)</a> above, these entries provide a very good starting point to identify
            the
            Areas of Specialisation that would be relevant to a given university.
        </p>

        <h4><em>Use of the IRINS Database:</em></h4>

        <p>
            After a preliminary clean-up of the IRINS data (taking care of singular/plural, acronyms, morphed phrases
            etc)
            a total of 943 distinct names of R&D areas (Topics of Specialistion) were identified for Anna University
            faculty
            from the IRINS data base, as supplied by about 500 faculty members. (The number of areas mentioned by one
            faculty
            varies hugely, from 2 to 7-8). These 943 items were divided into three broad Domains as below as felt
            appropriate for Anna University, shown along with the number of topics of specialisation for each domain:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Electrical and Computing Sciences (E&C): 292 topics</li>
            <li>Non- E&C: 533 topics</li>
            <li>Mathematics, Sciences & Humanities, and Management (MSHM): 118 topics</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The major exercise involved next was the clustering of these 943 items into a set of Clusters or Areas of
            Specialisation,
            the number of such sets being neither too large (dividing items that should be in one set into many sets;
            too fine a
            granularity), nor too small ( set including items that should in reality belong to other sets; too coarse a
            granularity).
            It requires good domain knowledge to know which items in the list of 943 topics belong to a particular
            cluster or area of
            specialisation, and can be done either manually or through a Machine Learning (ML) approach, or in a hybrid
            manner
            combining these two methods. Since 943 items is still relatively small, the manual approach was chosen here
            initially
            to validate the key ideas behind this investigation, and ML approach would be developed later and reported
            here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even in the manual approach used here, experts from different domains are needed to correctly assign the 943
            items
            (topics of specialisation) into appropriate set of clusters (areas of specialisation). This process however
            has
            large time and cost implications, and so for demo purposes here the authors have carried out the clustering
            task
            on their own based on their understanding of the domains involved. It is thus likely to turn out that the
            number
            and choice of clusters given here are more appropriate to the domain of E&C rather than the other two
            domains.
            This is only to validate the key ideas behind this pilot study, and a more detailed and accurate approach
            involving other experts is needed to make these results more accurate and meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking through the list of items in each of the three broad domains identified above, we divided them into
            30 clusters or areas of specialisation as below:
        </p>

        <ol type="A">
            <li>
                E&C Domain: 10 areas or clusters as below -

                    <li>Communications</li>
                    <li>Computers</li>

            </li>
            <li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Maths, Sciences & Humanities and Management Domains: 3 areas or clusters as below -
