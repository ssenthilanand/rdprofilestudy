        <h2><em>IV. Some preliminary results for Anna University</em></h2>
    </header>
    <article style="text-align: justify;">

        <p>
            Some preliminary results of our work done so far are given <a
                href="../analysis/index.html">here</a>
            where the 41 areas are arranged into three layers according to the number of faculty involved in each of
            them, as
            below:
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Top layer:</em> Areas having Faculty strength above 50 each (the maximum is seen to be 70)<br>
            <em>Middle layer:</em> Faculty strength in the range 26 to 50<br>
            <em>Bottom layer:</em> Faculty strength in the range 1 to 25 (the lowest is 4)<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Each of the 3 broad domains (A,B and C) is shown in one colour. The size of the circle is proportional
            to the logarithm of the faculty strength, making the circle having the largest number the biggest, and
            the circle having the least number of faculty as the smallest. On clicking the circles, details of their
            sub areas (topics) and faculty list are displayed, with the faculty names being linked to their IRINS
            database entries.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also a provision made for searching for a required topic of specialisation by clicking 
            <a href="analysis/search.html">here</a> which returns 
            the list of faculty members involved in that area, linked to their IRINS web pages.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is emphasised here again that these results are shown only as a PoC, and considerably more work 
            needs to be done to make it more effective and useful. For instance, areas like Mechanical, Computers 
            etc are really not specialisations (as in the sense of Mining or Grid/Cloud Computing), and these 
            will have to be examined as to how and where the items under them can be re-assigned to 
            existing Areas of specialisations, or to new Areas of specialisations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, ordering the Areas (Clusters) in terms of their faculty strengths as shown in the figure is 
            not particularly useful since more faculty does not necessarily mean higher R&D strengths. 
            R&D strengths of different Areas (Clusters) have to be computed using the methods suggested in 
            <a href="part2.html">Section II</a> above, and then ranked accordingly. Unfortunately, IRINS database is not of much use 
            in this regard as mentioned earlier. This will have to be done afresh using techniques of web crawling, 
            information extraction etc from the primary sources of information available elsewhere for the 
            common metrices like Publications, Research Grants, Patents, Theses, etc.
