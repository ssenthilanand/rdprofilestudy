    <p><em>Some preliminary results of an analysis carried out of the R&D profile of
        University Departments of Anna University is presented here that gives an overview
        of the research being done by the faculty in the various areas of engineering,
        sciences, mathematics and humanities. This is still a work in progress and
        would be continuously enhanced and updated.</em></p>

    <p>IRINS <a href="https://irins.org/irins/">(https://irins.org/irins/)</a> is a web-based Research Information
      Management (RIM)
      service developed recently by the Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET) in
      collaboration with the Central University of Punjab. Anna University has populated
      the template supplied by IRINS with data of about 500 of its regular faculty,
      and the same is available at <a href="https://annauniv.irins.org/">https://annauniv.irins.org/</a></p>

    <p>
      One of the information provided by the faculty members in the database is about the topics
      in which they are specialising, and in all we have identified 956 such distinct <span
        style="text-decoration: underline">topics</span>
      of specialisation for Anna University, belonging to 3 broad <span
        style="text-decoration: underline">domains</span>:
    </p>


    <ol type="A">
      <li>Engineering: Electrical and Computing Sciences (E&C)</li>
      <li>Engineering: Non- E&C areas</li>
      <li>Mathematics, Sciences & Humanities, and Management</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Through a first cut manual process, we have grouped the 956 topics into 41 clusters or
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">areas</span> of specialisation â€“
      10 belonging to E&C Sciences domain, 28 belonging to non-E&C domain and
      3 belonging to Maths, Sciences & Humanities and Management Domains. While
      the Domains (3) are too broad and Topics (956) are too narrow, the Areas (41)
      are believed to be of optimum granularity and size for meaningful understanding
      and interpretation of the R&D activities being carried out by the faculty of Anna University.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some preliminary results of the analysis are given here in two forms:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong style="text-decoration: underline">1. The Clusters.</strong> The 41 clusters (areas of specialisation),
      along with the constituents
      of each of them are available <a href="analysis/index.html">here</a> where clusters are arranged into 3
      layers according to the number of faculty involved in each of them.
      Also each of the 3 broad domains (A,B and C) is shown in one colour:
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color:#813762"><strong>A. Electrical & Computing (E&C) Sciences</strong>
      </span><br>
      <span style="color:#003f5c"><strong>B. Non-E&C areas</strong>
      </span><br>
      <span style="color:#905e00"><strong>C. Maths, Sciences, Management & Humanities</strong>
      </span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      The size of the circle is proportional to the logarithm of the faculty strength.
      On clicking the circles, details of their sub areas (topics) and associated
      faculty list are displayed, with the faculty names being linked to their IRINS database entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examination of the cluster details (such as AI, Composites, Automation etc.) clearly
      shows how the existing departments/centres division do not any more represent research
      specialisations, with each area of specialisation having faculty from 8-10 different
      departments/centres, spread across different university campuses. Planning and Organisation
      of R&D in the university may have to be conceived around these clusters instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong style="text-decoration: underline">2. The Search Facility</strong> Search can
      be carried out <a href="analysis/search.html">here</a> , either by names of the topics
      or by faculty names. In place of searching, the 956 topics have also been listed here
      alphabetically which can be scrolled down to the desired one and see the faculty involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both the clustering and the search facilities are presently being further automated and
      enhanced, and the improved results will be posted here from time to time.
