    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Abstract</em></h3>
    <p><em>It is often very difficult to get accurate and authentic information regarding the research strengths of the
        different faculty members as well as of the different specialised R&D areas in a university, especially large
        public universities.
        A computational model and a software tool are proposed here that can be interrogated to yield the required
        information for
        universities or other similar institutions. The core of the model is a way of computing the relative R&D score
        <strong>s(i,j)</strong>
        for a faculty member <strong>i</strong> in a given area <strong>j</strong> taking into account his/her different
        contributions like publications, theses,
        patents, funded activities etc. in that area. The results can be organised to rank faculty members,
        departments/centres,
        areas of specialisation etc in the university as per their relative R&D strengths. Clusters of related and
        connected R&D areas
        can be identified, along with the faculty members who are active in them, and these clusters can be made the
        units for planning
        future directions of research, in place of, or in addition to, just the departments and centres of the
        university. Some preliminary
        results of this ongoing investigation using the publicly available IRINS Database (<a
          href="https://irins.org/irins/">https://irins.org/irins/</a>) are presented.</em></p>

    <h3><em>I. The Problem Statement</em></h3>
  </header>

  <article style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>Unlike an industrial R&D Lab, there is not much top-down regulation in a university as to who works in what
      areas of research
      - the common practice is that faculty members from a number of departments work on a given topic,
      the same faculty member contributes to more than one topic, which also changes with time, etc.
      There is practically no way for the university administration to find answers to queries like the following
      that they are often faced with :</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Which are the top ten strongest areas of R&D in the university and how are they ranked?</li>
      <li>Who are the top ten or twenty researchers in the university in terms of their R&D strengths, and how are
        they ranked?</li>
      <li>In terms of their R&D strengths, which are the top 5 Departments/Centres in the university, and how are
        they ranked?</li>
      <li>How have the above pictures been changing over time, and what are the predictions for the next 5-10
        years?</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As is well known, a number of items go into deciding the R&D strength of a faculty member in a given area of
      specialisation, such as</p>

    <ul>
      <li>number and quality of research publications in that area</li>
      <li>number and quality of research theses supervised in that area</li>
      <li>externally funded activities taken up in that area, such as sponsored projects, consultancy, training,
        testing etc.</li>
      <li>patents and other IP s obtained and licensed out in that area</li>
      <li>national/international research collaborations/networks established in that area</li>
      <li>high quality conferences conducted in that area</li>
      <li>specialised courses developed and taught in that area</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The only organised source of information that is normally available are the Annual Reports submitted by the
      Departments/Centres
      to the university administration that would contain some of this information, but in a raw, unprocessed
      form, and the quality
      dimension being mostly not present in them. These alone are woefully insufficient for the administration and
      management to
      accurately project the strengths of the university to outside entities like the governments, industry, user
      agencies,
      potential collaborators and funders etc. , as well take steps to internally rectify the visible weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>A need therefore exists to have a computational model and a software tool using Data Mining, Machine Learning
      and other AI-based
      approaches that when interrogated can yield answers to the kind of queries raised in the beginning of this
      page.
      It should ideally provide output such as the ones shown below for a given university:

    <h3><em>II. The Computational Model and the Tool</em></h3>
  </header>


  <article style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>Here we outline of the computational model developed by us to compute the R&D strength of the university in a
      given area, as well as the R&D strength of a given faculty member in all his/her areas of specialisation.</p>

    <p>There are two major parts to this exercise:</p>

    <h4 id="II.1"><em>1. Identifying which are the areas of specialisation that must be considered in a given
        university.</em></h4>

    <p>Typically a large university will have many hundreds of faculty members divided into scores of departments,
      divisions,
      centres etc, carrying out a variety of activities that go into making its R&D strength, as listed in the previous
      section,
      such as publications, theses, patents, funded R&D etc. What should a university take to be its areas of
      specialisation
      for the purpose of estimating its the R&D strength is a matter of considerable complexity, and this may not be the
      same across all the universities. </p>

    <p>To illustrate, in an engineering university, it wouldn't be enough to consider Civil, Electrical, Mechanical etc
      to be
      the areas of specialised R&D as they are too broad and coarse in granularity, each breaking down into many more
      specialised
      areas and sub areas. At another extreme, there may be just one or two faculty members working on a very narrow and
      highly
      specialised problem, and at the university level , these may not qualify to be listed as research areas of the
      university as
      they are too fine grained. What would be needed is an optimum level of granularity where the choice of areas of
      specialisation is not too coarse to loose meaning or not too fine to loose usefulness.</p>

    <p>Experts in the university have to deliberate and decide on this aspect based on the breadth and depth of R&D
      being
      carried out there. It is evident that certain areas that exist in one university may not exist in another, etc.
    </p>

    <p>Later in this report we explain how this problem is being addressed in this study for the present.</p>

    <h4 id="II.2"><em>2. Deciding how the R&D strength of a faculty member or an area of specialisation is to be
        computed.</em></h4>

    <p>R&D strength in an area would have to take into account the different types of R&D outputs generated in that
      area,
      such as publications, theses, patents, etc, as listed in the previous section. Evidently, these can not be just a
      numerical addition of all such items, as they all have different units and dimensions, as well as different levels
      of importance in contributing to the final calculated R&D strength. To illustrate, it has to be decided how much
      importance publications should be given in the calculation of R&D strength, as compared to say R&D grants brought
      in,
      patents taken, etc. That is, there has to a “weight” assigned to each type of contributions that go into the
      calculation of the R&D strength, and this would reflect what the university considers to be the relative
      importance
      of different types of contributions – some may consider publications to be more importance than R&D grants,
      where as some others may do the opposite, etc.</p>

    <p>Even when the weights for different types of contributions have been agreed up on, how the contributions have to
      be quantified and calculated for a given type is another issue to be decided. Taking the example of publications
      again, the value of contribution assigned to this type can not just be the total number of publications;
      the 'quality' of the journals or conferences where they were published (say the h-index of the journal)
      will also be very important in deciding the value of this contribution.</p>

    <p>Similar considerations apply to deciding the relative importance of all other types of R&D contributions that
      go into deciding the relative R&D strength of an area of specialisation in the university, or of
      a faculty member of the university in an area.</p>

    <p>We have built the model for computing the R&D strength in a university through defining a factor
      <strong>s(i,j)</strong> as
      being the R&D strength of the faculty member <strong>i</strong> in the area of specialisation <strong>j</strong>.
      Contributions of various
      types mentioned earlier by the faculty member <strong>i</strong> in the area <strong>j</strong> are summed
      together with appropriate ways
      of quantification and weights. Details of this would be described elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>The final R&D strength of the university in the area of specialisation <strong>j</strong>, <strong>S(j)</strong>
      is obtained by summing <strong>s(i,j)</strong>
      over all the faculty members <strong>i</strong> in the university, and similarly, the final R&D strength of the
      faculty <strong>i</strong>
      in all the areas of his/her specialisation, <strong>S(i)</strong> is got by summing <strong>s(i,j)</strong> over
      all the areas <strong>j</strong>.</p>

    <h3><em>III. Obtaining the R&D Profile of a university using the IRINS database</em></h3>
  </header>


  <article style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>Most universities do not have a centralised on line database of its faculty members and their profiles made
      available over the web.
      Faculty members however do maintain their personal webpages as a part of their Department/Centre websites,
      and anyone wanting
      to analyse the R&D profiles of the faculty members of the university has to go to these Department/Centre
      websites and pull out
      the required information from the individual faculty web pages available there. This is a very tedious
      process, and
      often the individual pages of many faculty members are also incomplete in many regards for our purposes.</p>

    <h4><em>The IRINS Database:</em></h4>

    <p>
      IRINS <a href="https://irins.org/irins/">(https://irins.org/irins/)</a> is a web-based Research Information
      Management (RIM)
      service developed recently by the Information and Library Network(INFLIBNET) Centre Delhi in collaboration
      with the Central
      University of Punjab. Anna University has populated the template supplied by IRINS with data of
      about 500 of its regular faculty, and is available at <a
        href="https://annauniv.irins.org/">https://annauniv.irins.org/</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Nearly 250 universities and institutes in India (Central government, State government as well as Private)
      have
      created their own versions of IRINS data bases, and this to our knowledge represents only one such
      instance that is available for public viewing and access at present.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though there is provision to add more fields as desired by the individual faculty members,
      most of the IRINS websites of universities have chosen to have only a few fields populated;
      in case of Anna University, only the following fields have been filled up by most of the 500 faculty
      members:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Information</li>
      <li>Expertise</li>
      <li>Experience</li>
      <li>Educational Qualifications</li>
      <li>Publications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      List of Publications however looks quite incomplete as well as defective in many cases and may not be much
      usable as it is. More importantly, the following information is not available in most cases, which are
      essential for our purpose of computing R&D strength as discussed earlier:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Externally funded activities taken up such as Sponsored R&D, Consultancy, Training etc.</li>
      <li>Titles of Ph. D. Theses supervised</li>
      <li>Technologies/ IP s/ Patents produced</li>
      <li>Conferences Organised</li>
      <li>Networking & Collaborations</li>
      <li>Specialised Courses taught</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thus, the IRINS database in the form as presently available in many cases such as Anna University is still
      quite removed from the comprehensive ones needed as mentioned earlier, though it is a good beginning
      and could be improved up on by interested institutions.</p>

    <p>
      For our purpose of computing the R&D strengths, the “Areas of Expertise” field filled up by the faculty
      members in IRINS is quite useful and usable directly. This is where the faculty members enter their
      broad areas of activity (“Aerospace”) as well as specialised R&D areas (“Propulsion”), and as mentioned
      in <a href="#II.1">(II)(1)</a> above, these entries provide a very good starting point to identify
      the
      Areas of Specialisation that would be relevant to a given university.
    </p>

    <h4><em>Use of the IRINS Database for Anna University:</em></h4>

    <p>
      After a preliminary clean-up of the IRINS data (taking care of singular/plural, acronyms, morphed phrases
      etc)
      a total of 956 distinct names of R&D areas (Topics of Specialistion) were identified for Anna University
      faculty
      from the IRINS data base, as supplied by about 500 faculty members. (The number of areas mentioned by one
      faculty
      varies hugely, from 2 to 7-8). These 956 items were divided into three broad Domains as below as felt
      appropriate for Anna University, shown along with the number of topics of specialisation for each domain:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Electrical and Computing Sciences (E&C): 292 topics</li>
      <li>Non- E&C: 542 topics</li>
      <li>Mathematics, Sciences & Humanities, and Management (MSHM): 122 topics</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The major exercise involved next was the clustering of these 956 items into a set of Clusters or Areas of
      Specialisation,
      the number of such sets being neither too large (dividing items that should be in one set into many sets;
      too fine a
      granularity), nor too small ( set including items that should in reality belong to other sets; too coarse a
      granularity).
      It requires good domain knowledge to know which items in the list of 956 topics belong to a particular
      cluster or area of
      specialisation, and can be done either manually or through a Machine Learning (ML) approach, or in a hybrid
      manner
      combining these two methods. Since 956 items is still relatively small, the manual approach was chosen here
      initially
      to validate the key ideas behind this investigation, and ML approach would be developed later and reported
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even in the manual approach used here, experts from different domains are needed to correctly assign the 956
      items
      (topics of specialisation) into appropriate set of clusters (areas of specialisation). This process however
      has
      large time and cost implications, and so for demo purposes here the authors have carried out the clustering
      task
      on their own based on their understanding of the domains involved. It is thus likely to turn out that the
      number
      and choice of clusters given here are more appropriate to the domain of E&C rather than the other two
      domains.
      This is only to validate the key ideas behind this pilot study, and a more detailed and accurate approach
      involving other experts is needed to make these results more accurate and meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking through the list of items in each of the three broad domains identified above, we divided them into
      41 clusters or areas of specialisation as below:
    </p>

    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        E&C Domain: 10 areas or clusters as below -
        <ul>

          <li>Computers</li>
          <li>Electronics</li>
          <li>Instrumentation/Control /Automation</li>
          <li>Networks</li>
          <li>Power & High Voltage</li>
          <li>Signal/Image Processing</li>
          <li>VLSI</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-E&C Domain: 28 areas or clusters as below -
        <ul>
          <li>Aerospace</li>

          <li>Water Pollution and Wastewater Treatment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Maths, Sciences & Humanities and Management Domains: 3 areas or clusters as below -
        <ul>
          <li>Mathematics</li>

  </header>
  <article style="text-align: justify;">

    <p>
      Some preliminary results of our work done so far are given <a href="analysis/index.html">here</a>
      where the 41 areas are arranged into three layers according to the number of faculty involved in each of
      them, as
      below:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Top layer:</em> Areas having Faculty strength above 50 each (the maximum is seen to be 70)<br>
      <em>Middle layer:</em> Faculty strength in the range 26 to 50<br>
      <em>Bottom layer:</em> Faculty strength in the range 1 to 25 (the lowest is 4)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of the 3 broad domains (A,B and C) is shown in one colour.

    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color:#813762"><strong>A. Electrical & Computing (E&C) Sciences</strong>

      </span><br>
    </p>

    <p> The size of the circle is proportional
      to the logarithm of the faculty strength, making the circle having the largest number the biggest, and
      the circle having the least number of faculty as the smallest. On clicking the circles, details of their
      sub areas (topics) and faculty list are displayed, with the faculty names being linked to their IRINS
      database entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also a provision made for searching for a required topic of specialisation by clicking
      <a href="analysis/search.html">here</a> which returns
      the list of faculty members involved in that area, linked to their IRINS web pages.
      The search facility here is still a work in progress
    </p>

    <p>
      It is emphasised here again that these results are shown only as a PoC, and considerably more work
      needs to be done to make it more effective and useful. For instance, areas like Chemical Engineering and
      Civil Engineering are really not specialisations (as in the sense of Mining or Grid/Cloud Computing), and these
      will have to be examined as to how and where the items under them can be re-assigned to
      existing Areas of specialisations, or to new Areas of specialisations. When this exercise is carried out,
      it is possible that the Areas of Specialisation (or Clusters) would go up from the present 41 to
      closer to 50. This should be thus be treated as a work in progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, ordering the Areas (Clusters) in terms of their faculty strengths as shown in the figure is
      not particularly useful since more faculty does not necessarily mean higher R&D strengths.
      R&D strengths of different Areas (Clusters) have to be computed using the methods suggested in
      <a href="#part2">Section II</a> above, and then ranked accordingly. Unfortunately, IRINS database is not of much
      use
      in this regard as mentioned earlier. This will have to be done afresh using techniques of web crawling,
      information extraction etc from the primary sources of information available elsewhere for the
      common metrices like Publications, Research Grants, Patents, Theses, etc. This matter is presently being explored
      further.
