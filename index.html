    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Abstract</em></h3>
    <p><em>It is often very difficult to get accurate and authentic information regarding the research strengths of the 
        different faculty members as well as of the different specialised R&D areas in a university, especially large public universities. 
        A computational model and a software tool are  proposed here that can be interrogated to yield the required information for 
        universities or other similar institutions. The core of the model is a way of computing the relative R&D score s(i,j) 
        for a faculty member i in a given area j taking into account his/her different contributions like publications, theses, 
        patents, funded activities etc. in that area.  The results can be organised to rank faculty members, departments/centres, 
        areas of specialisation etc in the university as per their relative R&D strengths. Clusters of related and connected R&D areas 
        can be identified, along with the faculty members who are active in them, and these clusters can be made the units for planning 
        future directions of research, in place of, or in addition to, just the departments and  centres of the university. Some preliminary 
        results of this ongoing investigation using the publicly available IRINS Database (<a href="https://irins.org/irins/">https://irins.org/irins/</a>) are presented.</em></p>
